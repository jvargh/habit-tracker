# Feature Specification: Habit Tracker App

**Feature Branch**: `001-habit-tracker-app`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "habit tracker app. use dummy data for habits. is should be able to add a habit, mark its progress - it should be gamified like achievments for hitting milestones. lets make sure that the landing page has a dashboard of habits, with some graphs. make sure to be able to rate habits. i should be able to edit habits, delete them and reorder them. ability to share a snapshot with my friends."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Habit Dashboard (Priority: P1)

A user opens the app and immediately sees an overview of all their habits with visual progress indicators, achievement status, and key metrics displayed through graphs and charts. This provides instant value by showing habit performance at a glance.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - users need to quickly understand their progress across all habits to stay motivated and engaged.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the app with sample habit data and verifying that dashboard displays habits, progress visualizations, and achievement indicators without requiring any user interaction.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has existing habits with tracked progress, **When** they open the app, **Then** they see a dashboard showing all habits with current streak counts, completion percentages, and recent progress trends
2. **Given** a user has earned achievements, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** achievement badges and milestone indicators are prominently displayed
3. **Given** habit data exists, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** graphs show progress trends, success rates, and habit performance comparisons

### User Story 2 - Track Daily Habit Progress (Priority: P1)

A user can mark habits as completed for the current day, updating their progress streaks and potentially unlocking achievements. This is the fundamental interaction that drives habit formation.

**Why this priority**: Daily progress tracking is essential for habit formation - without this, the app has no core purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a habit and marking it complete, verifying that progress indicators update and streaks increment correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has active habits, **When** they mark a habit as completed for today, **Then** the habit's streak counter increases and progress indicators update
2. **Given** a user completes a habit that triggers a milestone, **When** they mark it complete, **Then** an achievement notification appears with celebration effects
3. **Given** a user marks multiple habits complete, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** overall progress statistics reflect the updated completion status

---

### User Story 3 - Manage Habit Collection (Priority: P2)

A user can create new habits with custom settings, edit existing habits to adjust goals or descriptions, delete habits they no longer want to track, and reorder habits to match their priority preferences.

**Why this priority**: Habit management is critical for long-term engagement, allowing users to adapt their tracking as goals evolve.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating, editing, deleting, and reordering habits, verifying that each operation works independently and persists correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to track a new behavior, **When** they create a habit with a name and frequency goal, **Then** the habit appears in their dashboard with initial progress tracking ready
2. **Given** a user has existing habits, **When** they edit a habit's name, description, or target frequency, **Then** the changes persist and progress tracking continues seamlessly
3. **Given** a user has multiple habits, **When** they drag to reorder habits in their preferred sequence, **Then** the new order persists across app sessions
4. **Given** a user no longer wants to track a habit, **When** they delete it, **Then** the habit disappears from their dashboard and all associated data is removed

---

### User Story 4 - Rate and Review Habit Performance (Priority: P3)

A user can assign ratings to their habits based on difficulty, satisfaction, or personal importance, helping them understand which habits are most valuable and sustainable for their lifestyle.

**Why this priority**: Rating provides valuable self-reflection and helps users optimize their habit selection over time.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding ratings to existing habits and verifying that ratings display correctly and can be modified.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has established habits, **When** they assign a 1-5 star rating to a habit, **Then** the rating displays consistently across the app interface
2. **Given** a user wants to evaluate habit difficulty, **When** they rate multiple habits, **Then** they can view habits sorted by rating to identify patterns
3. **Given** a user changes their opinion about a habit, **When** they update its rating, **Then** the new rating replaces the previous one and updates any rating-based sorting

---

### User Story 5 - Share Progress Snapshots (Priority: P3)

A user can generate and share a visual summary of their habit progress with friends through social media, messaging, or other sharing methods to build accountability and celebrate achievements.

**Why this priority**: Social sharing increases motivation through accountability and celebration, though it's not essential for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating a shareable snapshot from habit data and verifying that it contains appropriate progress summary and sharing functionality works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has habit progress to share, **When** they request a progress snapshot, **Then** a text summary generates showing key metrics, achievements, and current streaks
2. **Given** a user wants to share their progress, **When** they tap the share button on their snapshot, **Then** standard sharing options appear for social media, messaging, and other apps
3. **Given** a user shares a snapshot, **When** recipients view it, **Then** the snapshot clearly communicates the user's habit achievements without requiring app installation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to mark a habit complete multiple times in the same day? (System blocks additional marks and shows already-completed status)
- What occurs when a user has no habits configured and visits the dashboard?
- How are daily streak milestones calculated and displayed for new habits with no completion history?
- What happens to progress data when a user edits a habit's name or description mid-streak?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a dashboard showing all user habits with current progress, streaks, and completion status
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to mark habits as completed once per day with immediate visual feedback and progress updates, blocking additional completion attempts for the same day
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to create new habits with customizable names and descriptions, with all habits being daily frequency only
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement a gamification system with achievements based on daily streak milestones (3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 100 days) and celebration effects when milestones are reached
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide visual progress representations through charts and graphs showing trends over time
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to edit existing habits including name and description (frequency is fixed as daily)
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to delete habits with confirmation to prevent accidental removal
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to reorder habits through drag-and-drop or similar intuitive interaction
- **FR-009**: System MUST support habit rating functionality allowing users to assign 1-5 star ratings
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate shareable progress snapshots as text summaries containing key metrics such as total habits, current streaks, and achievements earned
- **FR-011**: System MUST populate with dummy/sample habit data for demonstration and testing purposes
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist all user changes and progress tracking in local device storage across app sessions with no cloud synchronization

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves content/data)*
