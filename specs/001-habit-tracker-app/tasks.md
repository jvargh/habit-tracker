# Tasks: Habit Tracker App

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-habit-tracker-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Test tasks are included based on the plan.md testing strategy (Jest + React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] **T011** - Create TypeScript type definitions for Habit, HabitEntry, Achievement, etc.
- [x] **T012** - Create storage service for localStorage operations
- [x] **T013** - Create utility functions for date calculations, habit stats, etc.
- [x] **T014** - Create base UI components (Button, Card, Input, Modal)
- [x] **T015** - Create Layout components (Header, Navigation, Layout)
- [x] T016 Create base Button component in components/ui/Button.tsx
- [x] T017 [P] Create Modal component in components/ui/Modal.tsx
- [x] T018 [P] Create root layout component in app/layout.tsx
- [x] T019 Setup dummy/sample habit data for testing and demonstration

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 & US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US3 but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses data from US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Components before integration
- Core implementation before UI enhancements
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for HabitCard component in tests/components/HabitCard.test.tsx"
Task: "Unit test for HabitList component in tests/components/HabitList.test.tsx"
Task: "Integration test for dashboard loading in tests/integration/dashboard.test.tsx"
Task: "E2E test for dashboard viewing in tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts"

# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create HabitCard component in components/habits/HabitCard.tsx"
Task: "Create HabitList component in components/habits/HabitList.tsx"
Task: "Create ProgressChart component in components/charts/ProgressChart.tsx"
Task: "Create WeeklyChart component in components/charts/WeeklyChart.tsx"
Task: "Create achievement badge components in components/ui/AchievementBadge.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Dashboard View)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Progress Tracking)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both user stories independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Stories 4 & 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 & 2 (P1 priority)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (P2 priority)
   - Developer C: User Stories 4 & 5 (P3 priority)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- MVP scope includes User Stories 1 & 2 (P1 priority)
- Static export configuration ensures no server dependencies
