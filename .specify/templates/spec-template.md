# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "generate static HTML from markdown"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "optimize images during build"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "navigate without JavaScript"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "process templates without external APIs"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "validate all links before deployment"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST support content formats [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: markdown only, or also AsciiDoc, MDX?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST optimize assets for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target bundle size not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves content/data)*

- **[Content Type 1]**: [e.g., Page - represents site pages, attributes: title, content, metadata]
- **[Content Type 2]**: [e.g., Template - represents layout templates, relationships to content types]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Site loads in under 3 seconds on 3G connection"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Build process completes in under 30 seconds for 100 pages"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of content editors can create pages without technical help"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce deployment complexity by eliminating server requirements"]
